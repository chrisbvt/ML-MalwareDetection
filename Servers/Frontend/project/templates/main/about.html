        <h2> Why Grimm Malware Insights Portal? </h2>
        <p> Ever wonder if a file is malicious? We go through the steps hashing
        and searching for the files online but is that really a good indicator?
        With Grimm's Insight portal we strive to give users a better answer
        through machine learning. Here at Grimm, we took hundreds of
         thousands of malicious files and fed them into a series of neural
         networks to find patterns to indicate if a file's behavior is
         malicious or benign. </p>
